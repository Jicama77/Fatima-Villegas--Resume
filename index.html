        <div class="subheading mb-5">Liberal Studiesüè´</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am 18 years old and am currently a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. I decided I wanted to be a Liberal Studies major because I love children, and being around them brings me happiness. Therefore my only available options were becoming an elementary school teacher or a pediatrician. Unfortunately science and I do not get along very well so my only option, and rather preferrable to science, was Liberal Studies. Since I am only a freshman, college has been an interesting experience so far. I hope to have memorable and time-worthy encounters and involvement in and on this campus in the future.<br><br>

        In my spare time I like to binge watch movies, usually romcoms or just plain comedies. I also play my guitar and ukelele, especially when I am stressing out over anything and just need to get away from it. I do not deal well with stress seeing that I have anxiety but I am relieved I have options that ease that anxiety. I additionally enjoy volunteering and assisting my church known as San Salvador Catholic Church, in Colton. The people there are very friendly and it is a very supportive community. Knowing I have the privilege of helping out there in both big and small events makes me feel great both internally and externally. I would say that my greatest accomplishments in this parish is leading a youth choir. I am known for being rather quiet and reserved but when I was put in charge of these young people, it felt right and I was able to get through to them with ease.<br><br>

        My plans for the future after graduating UCR are to attend graduate school to receive my master's degree and also earn my teaching credential. I plan on pursuing a career in teaching at an elementary school, like I mentioned before. I believe that teachers, especially those working in elementary schools, are very underappreciated. When in reality they are the ones who initiate the education of most children. My biggest inspiration has to be my fifth grade teacher Mrs. Franklin. She has been very supportive ever since I told her what my future career will be and I greatly appreciate her support. That is why I aspire to be an influential teacher, like her, and be successful no matter how many challenges I face. Maybe in the near future I will also inspire the young children, whom I will teach, to be honest and caring individuals who appreciate their elementary instructors and who value their education. And I consider myself to be a nice, calm, patient person. Therefore I do not foresee having difficulties in getting along with the future youngsters.
